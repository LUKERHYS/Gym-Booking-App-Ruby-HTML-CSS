# Gym Booking App

### A full CRUD application built with Ruby, Sinatra, PSQL, HTML & CSS. This application used a custom restAPI API to serve data from a Postgres SQL database to a Ruby/Sinatra front end.

A local gym has asked you to build a piece of software to help them to manage memberships, and register members for classes.

## MVP

* The app should allow the gym to create / edit / delete members
* The app should allow the gym to create / edit / delete classes
* The app should allow the gym to add members to specific classes
* The app should show a list of all upcoming classes
* The app should show all members that are registered for a particular class

## Where did I get to?

I completed all of mvp and then spent what time I had left making sure that the app looked as though MVP was complete.
I felt as though a more polished looking application that fulfils MVP was better than a rushed set of extensions that
feel unusable and unfinished.
